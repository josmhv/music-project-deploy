# Music player
This is the first project I have made, and I'm currently making.
It's a music player in which you can search for songs in youtube an play them on an auto-created play-list
For now, it can only handle youtube URLs, but I'm planning on adding the functionality mentioned above and (I don't know how) create a data base for each person who enters in the app. And more functionalitys in the GUI but I'm working on discovering how to make them using React.
